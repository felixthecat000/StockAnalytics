# Refactoring Project

I am trying to learn Plotly Dash and I came across a great post on Medium by Jacques Sham (author of original repository where this is forked from). I have a background in stock broking prior to my data science days, so I thought this would be an excellent project to build on for learning purposes. 

What I particularly liked about Jacques' <a href="https://medium.com/@jjsham/predicting-s-p-500-with-time-series-statistical-learning-8b9277e30b2a">Medium post</a> was including original hand-drawn designs. More people should do this.

My only goal is to refactor the 'SimpleDashboard' part of the project, I will delete all other files and folders but there are more interesting things to see in Jacques' <a href="https://github.com/jacquessham/StockAnalytics">GitHub repository</a>.

In the [Simple Stock Price Dashboard Folder](SimpleDashboard), I include a list of refactoring tasks and tackle them one-by-one.
